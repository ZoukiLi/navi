#----------README----------#
#---Project Introduction---#
#This project uses C language to implement a Navi-based virtual machine,
#and a simplified version of the C language (hereinafter referred to as C--) compiler CCN
#for the virtual machine.
#There are three subfolders under the main directory: CCN, Navi, doc.
#CCN is used to store the relevant source code of the compiler CCN.
#Navi is used to store the implementation-related source code of the virtual machine.
#doc is used to store relevant documentation.
#-----------Navi-----------#
#Navi is a rudimentary stack-based virtual machine paradigm that contains
#an imperfect instruction collection system.
#It has NOT been used on any real CPUs.
#ONLY USED FOR SELF-PRACTICE.
#For details about Navi paradigm, see ./doc/Navi.pdf
#-----------CCN------------#
#CCN is C-- Compiler for Navi.
#C--(C_Minus_Minus) is a subset of the C language,
#which removes some of the grammatical rules in the C language for easier implementation.
#For details about C-- language, see ./doc/C_Minus_Minus.pdf
